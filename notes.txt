CS184 Final Project Notes

General Idea: 
- new distance to object: microlens focal distance + lens focal distance
- can easily calculate where on the microlens we are (sampling)
    - do the same thing as before, but with the microlens as the second location
    - also need to make sure ray actually hits the lens
        - if not, then continue sampling
    - final ray that we output is the one that goes from main lens to object
- need to store things differently, so need to edit the method that calls this
- need to store radiance, so the direction (not just the total sum)
    - but when recreating the image, need to sum it all up
- Need to find ratio between microlenses and main lens such that we use as many photosensor pixels as possible

Implementation Notes:
- image plane still at 1, but plane of focus is now at - (lens_focal_distance + microlens_focal_distance)
- first lens is at 0, second lens is at lens_focal_distance
